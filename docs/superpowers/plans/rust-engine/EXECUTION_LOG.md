# Rust engine rewrite — execution log

Append-only narrative behind `SHARDS.tsv` (which is the machine-readable
source of truth every orchestrator session loads first).

## 2026-07-16

- Go signal received from Ice. Program opened.
- Rev 2 plan written after a 9-agent audit (6 claim verifiers: 14/16
  confirmed, 2 corrected, 0 wrong; 3 adversarial reviewers: 37 findings,
  8 P0 — all incorporated). Audit transcript:
  session workflow `wf_34a62e66-de2`.
- Environment verified on host `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (Windows 11 Pro
  10.0.22631), repo at `main` = `5b6d2009`, working tree clean. Commands:
  `cargo --version` → 1.96.1; `rustc --version` → 1.96.1;
  `codex --version` → 0.142.5 (later updated, below); `gh auth status` →
  authenticated with repo scope; `git status --short` → clean.
- Wave 0 opened: R00 scaffolding (this commit), YRS-SPIKE and
  R01-INVENTORY launched as background workstreams.
- R00 PR: dohc-ai/dohc#137.
- Codex CLI fixed (R00 checklist): 0.142.5 rejected `gpt-5.6-sol`
  server-side; `codex update` self-updater fails from Git Bash
  (PowerShell sub-invocation error); updated via pwsh installer to
  0.144.5; `codex exec` on the gpt-5.6-sol default verified working.
- Portability guardrails added to the plan (library-first core, trait
  seams in core crates, in-process protocol transport) + open decision 9
  (mobile/web hosts deferred). Requested and approved by Ice.
- PR #137 review round 1: CodeRabbit (13 actionable) + Codex (8 findings)
  all triaged valid and fixed in one batch — Gate 0 split from the go
  signal, fixture sanitization rules, stale-device epoch rejection,
  persisted post-settle inventory, triplet handle probe, export location
  outside workspace root, schema validation tightening + approved-unsafe
  path, SHARDS machine-readability (R00 narrowed, INTEGRATOR row, R13/R13b
  dependency fix), program-control docs review tier, enforceable build
  slots/disk hysteresis, Defender exclusions narrowed to build caches.
- R01-INVENTORY landed as PR #138 (branch codex/rust-engine-r01-inventory,
  new files only): 229 behaviors (52 critical/63 high), 218 exports
  (20 retired-delete, 2 decision-required), 44 test files classified
  (18 portable / 17 sql-oracle / 5 hook-dependent / 4 impl-specific),
  114 determinism sites (38 block trace determinism). 11-agent workflow
  wf_08d4899b-e02, 0 malformed rows on assembly validation.
- TS-NATIVE-CI landed as PR #139: native engine-suite matrix
  (windows-latest / macos-latest arm64 / ubuntu-latest) with arch
  assertion; the PR's own CI run is the first native Windows/macOS
  execution of the oracle suite. Known gap logged: no native macOS x64
  runner (open decision 2).
- R03 protocol spike launched (background agent, isolated worktree,
  branch codex/rust-engine-r03).
- YRS-SPIKE verdict: PASS (PR #140). 21/21 fidelity docs incl. 9 real
  dogfood lineages; 1,000 seeded fuzz runs clean; yjs 13.6.30 <-> yrs
  0.27.3 pinned. Sole abort criterion cleared. Binding R11 constraints
  recorded in DECISIONS.md (OffsetKind::Utf16 mandatory, nested map key
  sorting, UTF-16 well-formedness at adapter, shared root schema +
  destructive projection provenance). Safety fences verified held
  (copy-only harvest, fixtures local/gitignored, zero unsafe).
- PR #137 review round 2: CodeRabbit APPROVED; Codex posted 8 findings
  (1 P1: replicated Y.Doc rows are durable lineage, not prunable cache —
  plan section split into local-only vs replicated regimes; 7 P2: SHARDS
  gate rows GATE0/GATE6 for resolvable deps, R01-CONTRACTS shard for
  Gate 0 contract docs, R05 owns versions module, R13b owns flagged
  integration files, packet-builder ownership consistency, unsafe CI scan
  detector). All fixed.
- PR #139 CI BLOCKED: GitHub Actions billing failure at the org — no job
  starts on any runner. Escalated to Ice (open decision 2 now includes
  restoring Actions billing).
- R03 protocol spike delivered (PR #141, dormant crate
  dohc-engine-protocol): recommendation = length-framed JSON control
  frames + raw binary blob-chunk frames; serde structs as single schema
  source (ts-rs -> TS types, schemars -> JSON Schema); CBOR held as
  negotiated upgrade. Measurements: worst-case metadata JSON penalty
  ~1.5ms vs 1,500ms budget; raw chunk frames 4.7-6.6 GB/s vs 0.4-0.5 for
  base64-JSON; V8 JSON.parse decodes fastest on the JS peer. 35 Rust +
  7 Node tests over byte-identical shared fixtures; panic-free decoder;
  in-process transport with zero serde in path (portability guardrail 3).
  Two protocol-freeze escalations recorded: engine->client event flow
  control (bounded buffer + overflow policy), and per-method param/result
  schemas to close dual-implementation validation drift. Open decision 1
  now has its evidence; Ice ratifies at Gate 0.
- PR #140 local Claude review 1/2 (robustness/security): verdict UPHELD,
  5 non-blocking P2 hardening findings (symlink-bypassable harvest guard,
  hang-on-crash driver, u32 overflow nit, truncation-only fault model to
  narrow in report, Node>=22 note). Fix batch pending reviewer 2/2.
- PR #140 local Claude review 2/2 (evidence integrity): verdict UPHELD
  with independent reproduction (fidelity re-run, 25-seed fuzz matching
  report distributions ~2%, determinism probe 3x identical, Bytes crash
  re-demonstrated at yrs block.rs:1613). 2 P1 (synthetic-only fallback
  silently passes without harvested fixtures + single-update-blob corpus
  never exercises reverse-order path; truncation acceptance warns instead
  of failing) + 4 P2 (pinned Bytes probe, base clientID by construction,
  undeclaredRoot placeholder equality, skip-vs-fault classifier). Codex
  bot added 4 P2s. All 15 findings dispatched to the spike fixer as one
  batch; strict re-certification run required before re-review.
